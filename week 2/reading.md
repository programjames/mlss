**Discussion Questions**
- What is the basic premise of the Bitter Lesson? What is the best evidence for and against it?
	-  The basic premise is more computation has historically been the way to better AI, not better algorithms, so we should stop wasting time trying to make better algorithms.
	- A great counterexample is GAN's -- we didn't have good picture generation until better algorithms. Also, deeper AI needs better memory management (to keep memory down the whole chain).
- Do some research online. Are there tasks for which compute scaling hasn’t so far been enough to solve the problem?
	- Understanding context, humor, anything unsaid but known from the wider culture.
	- AI isn't so great at writing huge pieces of text, it forgets what it had been talking about.
	- It's getting better at math/physics/etc. but still very lacking at critical thinking.
	- Learning continuously/while in operation.
- If compute scaling continues to be increasingly important, what does that imply about where future AI research will be conducted (e.g. which companies, universities, etc.)?
	- It will be conducted places where they have the money to buy processors, or where they already produce them. Universities would be Harvard, MIT, and other schools with large foundations. Companies would be Amazon, Google, and Intel. Countries would be China, Taiwan, and Korea.
- If compute scaling continues to be increasingly important, what does that imply about the number of engineers that will be needed to conduct ML research?
	- Less software engineers, but far more electrical & computer engineers.
- In the Roodman reading, consider the quote from Thomas Jefferson. Do you think it could describe AI?
	- No, it's just how knowledge works.
- Why might it be useful to model larger trends like GWP and scaling laws?
	- Humans and societies are complex, these are simple numbers.
- What is the biggest limitation of Roodman’s work, in your opinion?
	- It takes individual humans to make huge ripples in the model. Plus, people recognize the growth rate could lead to an implosion (global warming), so they don't grow unsustainably.
