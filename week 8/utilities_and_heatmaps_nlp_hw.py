# Saliency Map for NLP (heatmap) v1.1

We begin with learning about how to generate heatmaps to visualize a per token model explanation.  We will be using the package `thermostat` which provides a score per token.  Later in the homework you will investigate creating that score yourself by computing the gradients.

We're going to load the DeBerta model to see how to generate heatmaps from a model instead of using pregenerated model outputs.  

The basic plan we will be following is detailed below.

1.  We will be loading the model and corresponding tokenizer.  Note that the model and tokenizers go hand in hand.
1.  We will compute the gradients of the model and write up a description of what it means.
1.  We will recreate the above renderer to be able to display the utility of each word.
1. We will be examining some inconsistencies or failures of current language models.
1. We will ask you to see if you can discover any other inconsistencies yourself.

*  Please write equation for computing the gradient of the loss (L2 loss) with respect to the weights of the last layer.  This is a general equation not specific to any architecture or model.

*  Please describe what the gradients of the loss with respect to the inputs represents.
*  What does the does the gradient of the loss with respect to the input represent when you take the negative of the loss?

- We will take the L2 loss as
$$L = \frac{1}{2}\sum (l_i-y_i)^2$$

where $l_i$ are the various logits, satisfying $l = Wx$ where $W$ are the weights of the last layer, and $x$ the features right before the output layer. We find

$$\nabla L = (Wx-y)x^T = Wxx^T-yx^T.$$

- If the weights are a convolution kernel, then $Wxx^T$ will be zero except within the kernel, so we will get a matrix with bandwidth equal to the kernel size, minus $yx^T$. If it is a linear operator, that doesn't tell us anything new as all matrices are linear operators. We do know however, that the gradient will be smaller the closer $Wx$ is to $y$.
- The gradient with respect to the inputs, $x$, is
$$\nabla L = W^T(Wx-y) = W^T(l - y)$$
This essentially represents the difference between the logits and correct outputs, projected backwards through the model.
- When you take the negative of the loss, it's what you want to add to $x$ to correct the outputs.
