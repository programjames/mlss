# Intro to ML Safety course notes

This repository contains notes for the [Intro to ML Safety](https://course.mlsafety.org/) course.

Currently, the notes are not yet complete. We are looking for volunteers who will help us finish them. Ideally, notes will present the information from lectures and readings in a different way, so that students can have multiple angles of looking at the same material. Notes shouldn't just be notes from the lectures and ideally will include citations to papers.

If you would like to contribute to the course notes, feel free to make a pull request! We will credit you here and in the course notes.

Some prelimary notes on some of the topics already exist, but they aren't complete.
